# num_complex_solidity

`Complex` numbers for Solidity.

This library is in development (i.e. not extensively tested for deployment on the Ethereum mainnet). Please feel free to make a pull request with added functionality. 

Version 1.0

| Functions | Description |Gas Estimation |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| add | (a+bi) + (a+bi) | |
| sub | (a+bi) - (a+bi) | |
| mul | (a+bi) * (a+bi)| |
| div | (a+bi) / (a+bi) | |
| complexEXP | e^(a+bi) | | 
| r2 | a^2 + b^2 = c^2| |
| fromPolar | z=r(cosθ+isinθ) | |
| toPolar | z=r(cosθ+isinθ) | |
| atan2 | tan^-1 | |
| p_atan2 | precise tan^-1 | |
| atan1to1 | tan^-1 from -1 to 1 | |
| complexSQRT | (a+bi)^(1/2) | |
| intEXP | dev function int**int | |
| complexPOW | when n<1 (a+bi)^n | | 
| normalizeAmount | x / 1e18| | 
| deNormalizeAmount | x * 1e18 | |
| gasTest | dev function| |



# Usage

WIth npm:

import "@partylikeits1983/complex_sol/contracts/Complex.sol";

contract model {
    
    function test(int re, int im) public returns (int,int) {

        (re,im) = Complex.complexLN(re,im);

        return (re,im);
    }

```
